# Likeness-Vitals: Shared utility functionality for Likeness modules

## Conda environments

These Conda environments provide all dependencies required to use `livelike`, `pymedm` / `pmedm-legacy`, and `likeness-vitals`. 

The install script will automatically choose between the vanilla and CUDA environment based on system type. To run it: 

```
bash setup.sh
```
